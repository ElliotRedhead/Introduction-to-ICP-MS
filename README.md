# Introduction-to-ICP-MS
-------------------------
This is my first milestone project, an introduction to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Designed to be an educational tool, it covers the basic principle of the technique, the instrumentation, its application and its limitations.

## User Experience
 
This page explores the basic principles of inductively coupled plasma spectrometry.
The website features a general introduction to the technique, with deeper description of how the different #
components come together to form the analysis. The overall application and value of the analysis is covered
with examples of specific industries it is currently used in. The basics of the physical chemistry utilised 
are introduced.



The target audience is a science or science-related professional that is fluent in English.
The user is assumed to have a basic understanding of chemistry/science.
The user is potentially researching this method as a student or someone who is beginning a career in this field.

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

##User Stories

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

As a user with no prior knowledge of this method I want to ... so that I can ... READ
As a user with no prior knowledge of this method I want to ... so that I can ... READ
As a user with no prior knowledge of this method I want to ... so that I can ... READ

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

- Include links to mock and revised wireframes.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
-Nav
-Intro
-Info Sections (Individually)
-Footer
 
## Existing Features

#Navigation
The navigation is fully responsive to different resolutions, allowing the user easy access to any of the secvtions of the page and highlighting the current sections they are using using Scrollspy.
The overview section gives a brief introduction to the instrument, its analysis and degree of sensitivity. A list was included for this section to highlight the industries that it is applicable to. This section uses a single column layout as is the standard for information websites.

This section explains to the user what the role of the plasma is, an image is included to illustrate the physical chemistry concept that occurs upon analysis.

The analysis section describes the role of the raminder of the instrument in the analysis. A block diagram is included to illustrate how each each part of the instrument interacts, and allows the user to place the concepts to their positions.

The maintenance section is used to discuss the potential drawbacks and cost of ther instrument's running to give the user an idea of logistical challenges that many occur in its use.

The contact form allows the user to contact the author. Its presence invites questions and feedback, allowing both the user and creator to benefit from further discussion.

The option to share the page is given within the footer, if the user has decided that the information provided was valuable to them and would like to share it the available options are for Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. These sites were chosen as the most suitable target platforms for information distribution from an educational viewpoint.

- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

This project is developed with primarily HTML and CSS languages. These were chosen in order to fulfil the project requirements and are the languages that the developer has most experience in due to their suitability to website development.
The developer used Visual Studio Code to create the website. This was chosen due to the developer having established experience within this software and for its Github integration. https://code.visualstudio.com/
Bootstrap 4 is used extensively throughout the project. The main application of this was for its integration of the CSS Flexbox Grid system used throughout the layout of this website, with a secondary application of preset components used for suitability and developer ease-of-use. https://getbootstrap.com
FontAwesome is used within this project to provide categorical icons as found in the mobile navigation section. htttps://fontawesome.com/
GoogleFonts is used to supply the fonts for the majority of texts across this website, the fonts sourced in this way were Rubik and Roboto-Condensed. https://fonts.google.com/

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
