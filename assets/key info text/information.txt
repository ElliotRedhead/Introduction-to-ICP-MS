-------------------------- INTRODUCTION
Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) is used in sample analysis to determine which elements are present and their concentrations.

ICP-MS is applied in a variety of industries such as:
- environmental
- pharmaceutical
- geochemical
- forensics
These may be for ensuring guidelines are adhered to in terms of purity of final products, sufficient treatment of waste product, or for exploration of biological matrices for example. 

The greatest value provided by the instrument is the degree of sensitivity, with the ability to measure some elements at part-per-billion (ppb) level.
This measurement is defined as being one part in one billion units, in relative terms that is equivalent to 1mL of water in a 1000L swimming pool or 1 second in 31.7 years.

-------------------------- SAMPLE INTRODUCTION + PLASMA
The method of sample introduction to the instrument depends upon the state of the sample. ICP-MS is used for composition determination of solid and liquid samples, however only a minute amount of sample is sufficient for analysis. Prior to ionisation, solid samples are introduced using laser ablation; the focusing of a laser beam on the sample surface to generate fine particles whereas liquid samples undergo a nebulisation process.

[what is ionisation & diagram] The ionisation of an atom results in a positively charged ion (cation), this occurs when sufficient energy (ionisation energy) is applied to remove the valence (outer) electron from its orbital.

The plasma is generated by applying an oscillating radiofrequency to a constant flow of argon gas, the argon atoms experience a molecular friction as a large quantity of energy results in the ionisation of the argon. As argon is one of the most stable elements it is not readily ionised, therefore most elements that are then subjected to this high energy plasma are ionised. This ionisation allows manipulation of the charged particles for differentiation and selective quantification.

The instrumentation performs most optimally in a clean-room environment at a non-fluctuating temperature due to its high degree of sensitivity.
