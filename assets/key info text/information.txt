What is it? 
Example Industries: 
Optimal lab conditions
Value as a tool - sensitivity

Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) is used in sample analysis to determine which elements are present and their concentrations.

ICP-MS is applied in a variety of industries such as:
- environmental
- pharmaceutical
- geochemical
- forensics
These may be for ensuring guidelines are adhered to in terms of purity of final products, sufficient treatment of waste product, or for exploration of biological matrices for example. 

The greatest value provided by the instrument is the degree of sensitivity, with the ability to measure some elements at part-per-billion (ppb) level.
This measurement is defined as being one part in one billion units, in relative terms that is equivalent to 1mL of water in a 1000L swimming pool or 1 second in 31.7 years.

--------------------------

The instrumentation performs most optimally in a clean-room environment at a non-fluctuating temperature due to its high degree of sensitivity.
